  <title>Immunizing Programs</title>
  <para>
  Effective hardening of a computer system requires minimizing the number of
  programs that mediate privilege, then securing the programs as much as
  possible. With <phrase>AppArmor</phrase>, you only need to profile the programs that are
  exposed to attack in your environment, which drastically reduces the
  amount of work required to harden your computer. <phrase>AppArmor</phrase> profiles enforce
  policies to make sure that programs do what they are supposed to do, but
  nothing else.
 </para>
  <para><phrase>AppArmor</phrase> provides immunization technologies that protect applications from the
  inherent vulnerabilities they possess. After installing <phrase>AppArmor</phrase>, setting up
  <phrase>AppArmor</phrase> profiles, and rebooting the computer, your system becomes immunized
  because it begins to enforce the <phrase>AppArmor</phrase> security policies. Protecting
  programs with <phrase>AppArmor</phrase> is referred to as <emphasis>immunizing</emphasis>.
 </para>
  <para>
  Administrators need only concern themselves with the applications that are
  vulnerable to attacks, and generate profiles for these. Hardening a system
  thus comes down to building and maintaining the <phrase>AppArmor</phrase> profile set and
  monitoring any policy violations or exceptions logged by <phrase>AppArmor</phrase>'s reporting
  facility.
 </para>
  <para>
  Users should not notice <phrase>AppArmor</phrase> at all. It runs <quote>behind the
  scenes</quote> and does not require any user interaction. Performance is
  not noticeably affected by <phrase>AppArmor</phrase>. If some activity of the application is
  not covered by an <phrase>AppArmor</phrase> profile or if some activity of the application is
  prevented by <phrase>AppArmor</phrase>, the administrator needs to adjust the profile of this
  application to cover this kind of behavior.
 </para>
  <para><phrase>AppArmor</phrase> sets up a collection of default application profiles to protect
  standard Linux services. To protect other applications, use the <phrase>AppArmor</phrase> tools
  to create profiles for the applications that you want protected. This
  chapter introduces the philosophy of immunizing programs. Proceed to
  <xref linkend="cha.apparmor.profiles"/>,
  <xref linkend="cha.apparmor.yast"/>, or
  <xref linkend="cha.apparmor.commandline"/> if you are ready to build and
  manage <phrase>AppArmor</phrase> profiles.
 </para>
  <para><phrase>AppArmor</phrase> provides streamlined access control for network services by
  specifying which files each program is allowed to read, write, and
  execute, and which type of network it is allowed to access. This ensures
  that each program does what it is supposed to do, and nothing else. <phrase>AppArmor</phrase>
  quarantines programs to protect the rest of the system from being damaged
  by a compromised process.
 </para>
  <para><phrase>AppArmor</phrase> is a host intrusion prevention or mandatory access control scheme.
  Previously, access control schemes were centered around users because they
  were built for large timeshare systems. Alternatively, modern network
  servers largely do not permit users to log in, but instead provide a
  variety of network services for users (such as Web, mail, file, and print
  servers). <phrase>AppArmor</phrase> controls the access given to network services and other
  programs to prevent weaknesses from being exploited.

    To find Web applications, investigate your Web server configuration. The

    Once you find these programs, you can use the

      <para>
    Because CGI programs are executed by the Apache Web server, the profile
    for Apache itself, <filename>usr.sbin.httpd2-prefork</filename> for

    each of these programs. For instance, adding the line
    <literal>/srv/www/cgi-bin/my_hit_counter.pl rPx</literal> grants Apache
    permission to execute the Perl script
    <filename>my_hit_counter.pl</filename> and requires that there be a
    dedicated profile for <filename>my_hit_counter.pl</filename>. If
    <filename>my_hit_counter.pl</filename> does not have a dedicated profile
    associated with it, the rule should say
    <literal>/srv/www/cgi-bin/my_hit_counter.pl rix</literal> to cause
    <filename>my_hit_counter.pl</filename> to inherit the
    <filename>usr.sbin.httpd2-prefork</filename> profile.
   </para>
      <para>
    Some users might find it inconvenient to specify execute permission for
    every CGI script that Apache might invoke. Instead, the administrator
    can grant controlled access to collections of CGI scripts. For instance,
    adding the line <literal>/srv/www/cgi-bin/*.{pl,py,pyc} rix</literal>
    allows Apache to execute all files in
    <literal>/srv/www/cgi-bin/</literal> ending in <filename>.pl</filename>
    (Perl scripts) and <filename>.py</filename> or <filename>.pyc</filename>
    (Python scripts). As above, the <literal>ix</literal> part of the rule
    causes Python scripts to inherit the Apache profile, which is
    appropriate if you do not want to write individual profiles for each CGI
    script.

      <para>
    Profiling Web applications that use <filename>mod_perl</filename> and
    <filename>mod_php</filename> requires slightly different handling. In
    this case, the <quote>program</quote> is a script interpreted directly
    by the module within the Apache process, so no exec happens. Instead,
    the <phrase>AppArmor</phrase> version of Apache calls <command>change_hat()</command> using a
    subprofile (a <quote>hat</quote>) corresponding to the name of the URI
    requested.
   </para>
      <note>
        <para>
     The name presented for the script to execute might not be the URI,
     depending on how Apache has been configured for where to look for
     module scripts. If you have configured your Apache to place scripts in
     a different place, the different names appear in the log file when <phrase>AppArmor</phrase>
     complains about access violations. See
     <xref linkend="cha.apparmor.managing"/>.
    </para>
      </note>
      <para>
    For <filename>mod_perl</filename> and <filename>mod_php</filename>
    scripts, this is the name of the Perl script or the PHP page requested.
    For example, adding this subprofile allows the
    <filename>localtime.php</filename> page to execute and access to the
    local system time and locale files:
   </para>
      <screen>/usr/bin/httpd2-prefork {
  # ...
  ^/cgi-bin/localtime.php {
    /etc/localtime                  r,
    /srv/www/cgi-bin/localtime.php  r,
    /usr/lib/locale/**              r,
  }
}
</screen>
      <para>
    If no subprofile has been defined, the <phrase>AppArmor</phrase> version of Apache applies
    the <systemitem>DEFAULT_URI</systemitem> hat. This subprofile is
    sufficient to display a Web page. The
    <systemitem>DEFAULT_URI</systemitem> hat that <phrase>AppArmor</phrase> provides by default
    is the following:
   </para>
      <screen>^DEFAULT_URI {
    /usr/sbin/suexec2                  mixr,
    /var/log/apache2/**                rwl,
    @{HOME}/public_html                r,
    @{HOME}/public_html/**             r,
    /srv/www/htdocs                    r,
    /srv/www/htdocs/**                 r,
    /srv/www/icons/*.{gif,jpg,png}     r,
    /srv/www/vhosts                    r,
    /srv/www/vhosts/**                 r,
    /usr/share/apache2/**              r,
    /var/lib/php/sess_*                rwl 
}
    </screen>
      <para>
    To use a single <phrase>AppArmor</phrase> profile for all Web pages and CGI scripts served by
    Apache, a good approach is to edit the
    <systemitem>DEFAULT_URI</systemitem> subprofile. For more information on
    confining Web applications with Apache, see

      <para>
    To find network server daemons and network clients (such as
    <command>fetchmail</command> or Firefox) that need to be profiled, you
    should inspect the open ports on your machine, consider the programs
    that are answering on those ports, and provide profiles for as many of
    those programs as possible. If you provide profiles for all programs
    with open network ports, an attacker cannot get to the file system on
    your machine without passing through an <phrase>AppArmor</phrase> profile policy.

      <para>
    Scan your server for open network ports manually from outside the
    machine using a scanner (such as nmap), or from inside the machine using
    the <command>netstat --inet -n -p</command> command as <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>. Then,
    inspect the machine to determine which programs are answering on the
    discovered open ports.
