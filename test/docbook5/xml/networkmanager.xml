  NetworkManager is the ideal solution for laptops and other portable computers. With
  NetworkManager, you do not need to worry about configuring network interfaces and
  switching between networks when you are moving.

    <title>NetworkManager and <command>wicked</command></title>
    <para>
   However, NetworkManager is not a suitable solution for all cases, so you can still
   choose between the <command>wicked</command> controlled method for
   managing network connections and NetworkManager. If you want to manage your network
   connection with NetworkManager, enable NetworkManager in the YaST Network Settings module
   as described in <xref linkend="sec.nm.activate"/> and configure your
   network connections with NetworkManager. For a list of use cases and a detailed
   description of how to configure and use NetworkManager, refer to
   <xref linkend="cha.nm"/>.

      If you use NetworkManager for network setup, you can easily switch, stop or
      start your network connection at any time from within your desktop
      environment using an applet. NetworkManager also makes it possible to change and
      configure wireless card connections without requiring <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>
      privileges. For this reason, NetworkManager is the ideal solution for a mobile
      workstation.
     </para>
          <para><command>wicked</command> also provides some ways to switch, stop or
      start the connection with or without user intervention, like
      user-managed devices. However, this always requires <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>
      privileges to change or configure a network device. This is often a
      problem for mobile computing, where it is not possible to preconfigure
      all the connection possibilities.

          <para>
      Both <command>wicked</command> and NetworkManager can handle network
      connections with a wireless network (with WEP, WPA-PSK, and
      WPA-Enterprise access) and wired networks using DHCP and static
      configuration. They also support connection through dial-up and VPN.
      With NetworkManager you can also connect a mobile broadband (3G) modem
      or set up a DSL connection, which is not possible with the traditional
      configuration.
     </para>
          <para>
      NetworkManager tries to keep your computer connected at all times using the best
      connection available. If the network cable is accidentally
      disconnected, it tries to reconnect. It can find the network with the
      best signal strength from the list of your wireless connections and
      automatically use it to connect. To get the same functionality with
      <command>wicked</command>, more configuration effort is required.

    <title>NetworkManager Functionality and Configuration Files</title>
    <para>
   The individual network connection settings created with NetworkManager are stored
   in configuration profiles. The <emphasis>system</emphasis> connections
   configured with either NetworkManager or YaST are saved in
   <filename>/etc/networkmanager/system-connections/*</filename> or in
   <filename>/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*</filename>. For GNOME, all
   user-defined connections are stored in GConf.
  </para>
    <para>
   In case no profile is configured, NetworkManager automatically creates one and
   names it <literal>Auto $INTERFACE-NAME</literal>. That is made in an
   attempt to work without any configuration for as many cases as (securely)
   possible. If the automatically created profiles do not suit your needs,
   use the network connection configuration dialogs provided by GNOME to
   modify them as desired. For more information, see
   <xref linkend="sec.nm.configure"/>.

   On centrally administered machines, certain NetworkManager features can be
   controlled or disabled with PolKit, for example if a user is allowed to
   modify administrator defined connections or if a user is allowed to
   define his own network configurations. To view or change the respective
   NetworkManager policies, start the graphical <guimenu>Authorizations</guimenu> tool
   for PolKit. In the tree on the left side, find them below the
   <guimenu>network-manager-settings</guimenu> entry. For an introduction to
   PolKit and details on how to use it, refer to
