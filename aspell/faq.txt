Where can I get it?
-------------------

Just run "make update" and you will receive the files in trunk/novdoc/aspell/

How can I use use it?
---------------------

  * Command line

      aspell --mode=sgml --encoding=utf-8 --lang=en_US \
      --extra-dicts="<PATH TO NOVDOC DIRECTORY>/aspell/suse_aspell.rws \
      <FILENAME TO CHECK>

      (remove the "\" and put it all in one line
       replace the <...> parts with appropriate values )

  * Emacs

      Add the following lines to your custom emacs config file:

(add-hook 'sgml-mode-hook   
      '(lambda ()   
      (setq ispell-program-name "aspell")
      (ispell-change-dictionary "american")
      (setq ispell-extra-args '("--extra-dicts=<PATH TO NOVDOC \
DIRECTORY>/aspell/suse_aspell.rws"))))

  * vi

      vi users don't need help ;-))

  * kate/kwrite

      Enter the following command as user root:

      cp <PATH TO NOVDOC DIRECTORY>/aspell/suse_aspell.rws \
      <PATH TO NOVDOC DIRECTORY>/aspell/en_US-w_accents_suse.multi \
      /usr/lib/aspell-0.60

      Do the following as regular user:

      Alt + F2 kcontrol
      -> KDE Components -> Spell Checker

      Client: Aspell
      Dictionary: English (United States of America - w_accents_suse)

      Every time suse_aspell.rws gets updated, you need to copy it 
      to /usr/lib/aspell-0.60. You may instead create a link pointing to 
      suse_aspell.rws within the trunk, but I am not sure whether this is a 
      good idea...

  * oXygen

      oXygen comes with it's own spell checker and cannot use the aspell
      directory. However, a tool to build custom dictionaries from wordlists
      is available from http://www.xmlmind.com/spellchecker/dictbuilder.shtml
      The SUSE wordlist is available as text file at
      trunk/novdoc/aspell/suse_wordlist.txt

      0. Download the ZIP archive from http://www.xmlmind.com/spellchecker/dictbuilder.shtml
         and unpack it in this (aspell) directory.
      1. Run "make update"

      2. Create the dictionary

         Run the following command:

         <PATH TO DICTBUILDER-DIRECTORY>/dictbuilder -cs utf8 \
         <PATH TO NOVDOC DIRECTORY>/aspell/suse_wordlist.txt \
         -o <PATH TO NOVDOC DIRECTORY>/aspell/oxygen/en-US-SUSE/spec.cdi

      3. Add the SUSE dictionary to the oXygen dictionaries

         Run the following two commands:

         cd <PATH TO NOVDOC DIRECTORY>/aspell/oxygen

         zip -9 -r <PATH TO OXYGEN DIRECTORY>/dicts/en.dar \
         en-US-SUSE/ -x en-US-SUSE/.svn/\*

         Restart oXygen and go to Options -> Preferences -> Spell Check

         there now is a new dictionary available: English (US + SUSE)


What's currently missing?
-------------------------

The current dictionary does not include the following words that are 
present in our documents:

* All uppercase words (e.g. acronyms, variable names, etc.)
* two or three letter words

These words are located in trunk/novdoc/aspell/acronyms.txt - feel free 
to work on this file, it will get merged into the dictionary in the 
future. 


How can I add words?
--------------------

trunk/novdoc/aspell/suse_wordlist.txt is the source from where the 
dictionary is built. It is versioned in SVN and everybody can change 
the file. If you do so, please note the following:

* Only add words aspell does not already know

* If you add a noun, please also add it's plural (providing it exists)
  and genitive:

  apache
  apaches
  apache's

* Send a note to Rebecca - she has to proofread the new file before 
  building a new directory.

How can I generate a new dictionary?
-------------------------------------

Simply _don't do it_ if you are not Rebecca ;-).

Rebecca, once you have proofed a new wordlist you can generate a new 
directory with the following commands:

cd <PATH TO NOVDOC DIRECTORY>/aspell/
./make_dictionary.sh
