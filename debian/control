Description: DocBook Authoring and Publishing Suite (DAPS)
 DAPS contains a set of stylesheets, scripts and makefiles that enable
 you to create HTML, PDF, EPUB and other formats from DocBook XML with a
 single command. It also contains tools to generate profiled source
 tarballs for distributing your XML sources for translation or review.
 .
 DAPS also includes tools that assist you when writing DocBook XML:
 linkchecker, validator, spellchecker, editor macros and stylesheets for
 converting DocBook XML.
 .
 DAPS is the successor of susedoc. See
 /usr/share/doc/packages/daps/README.upgrade_from_susedoc_4.x
 for upgrade instructions.
