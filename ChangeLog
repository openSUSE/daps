Beta release DAPS 4.0.beta1:

* New features:
  - Support for DocBook assemblies
    - DocBook's topic-based authoring approach, the Assemblies
      (https://tdg.docbook.org/tdg/5.2/ch06.html) are now supported
      by DAPS. IF MAIN in the DC-file is set to an assembly, it
      will automatically be recognized as an assembly by DAPS and
      be converted to a bigfile that is then processed like a
      regular DocBook file.
      In case you assembly consists more than one structure, create
      a DC-file for each structure and set STRUCTID to the
      respective structure ID(s) in the DC file(s).
      NOTE: assembly-support in DocBook is still in development.
            DAPS requires DocBook 5.2-pre or better!
    - Limitations:
      File list commands (e.g. list-srcfiles) will not show the
      assembly files and included resources, but rather the bigfile.
      Images will be correctly listed.
      Similar limitations apply to the package-src and locdrop
      commands - the packages will contain the bigfile rather
      than the original sources.
      Correctly supporting these features is planned for future
      DAPS releases.
  - Custom source directories:
    - Previous DAPS versions required sources to be located in
      directories xml/ (DocBook) or adoc/ (ASCIIDoc) and
      images/src/<IMGFORMAT>. These directories had to be in the
      same directory as the respective DC-file.
      By setting SRC_DIR and IMG_SRC_DIR you now set custom
      directories for xml/adoc sources and images. Placing images
      in subdirectories representing their format is also no longer
      necessary (but still supported). This allows a much more
      flexible directory setup.
      Default settings are the ones inherited from DAPS 3.x:
      xml/ (DocBook) or adoc/ (ASCIIDoc) and
      images/src/<IMGFORMAT> (images).
      Values can be set via DC-file (for document-specific settings)
      or globally in /etc/daps/config or via the command-line
      (daps -d <DC> --imgsrcdir="foo/img" --srcdir="foo")
	!! Refer to the documentation for more details
      (incl. do's and dont's). !!
  - Always rebuild:
    - DAPS makes use of Makefiles to make sure only files that
      really need to be touched get rebuild. So if you would, for
      example build a PDF and then rebuild it again while the
      sources have not changed, DAPS would do nothing but displaying
      the link of the existing PDF. This considerably speeds up
      build times for large projects.
      However, it fails to recognize the necessity of a rebuild when
      changing stylesheets, or sometimes produces unwanted
      results. With DAPS 3.x you could specify daps --force to force
      rebuilding everything.
      With DAPS 4 rebuilding everything will become the new default.
      To restore the old behavior, set ALWAYS_REBUILD=no in
      /etc/daps.config (global setting), in ~/.config/daps/dapsrc
      (user setting), or in the DC-file (document setting).
  - New default spell-checker: hunspell
    - Switching from aspell to hunspell as the default spell checker
      To restore the old behavior, set SPELL_CHECLKER=aspell in
      /etc/daps.config (global setting), in ~/.config/daps/dapsrc
      (user setting), or in the DC-file (document setting). You can
      specify the spell checker on the command line, see
      daps spellcheck help
  - PDF file names:
    - In DAPS 3.x PDF file names for color PDFs followed the pattern
      <NAME>_color.pdf. The string "_color" has been removed from the
      filename. Note that graysacle PDFs continue to use the pattern
      <NAME>_grayscale.pdf
      (https://github.com/openSUSE/daps/issues/665)
  - PNG optimization
    - In DAPS 3.x, When optimizing PNGs with optipng an exif
      comment "optipng" was added to the image. However, when
      editing the image afterwards and saving it without
      optimization, it would be skipped by subsequent optipng runs,
      because the exif information was still there. The following
      has been changed:
      - exif information is no longer used (also removes dependency
	on exiftool)
      - with each optipng run, all images are scanned by optipng
        using "optipng -o0 -simulate" (which should not introduce
        a performance penalty compared to looking up EXIF information
      - if the check reveals a requirement for optimization
	the image is changed by a second optipng call
      - using "optipng -fix" also ensures to fix iCCP warnings
        with libpng > 1.6
      (https://github.com/openSUSE/daps/issues/513)
  - Improved file lists for ASCIIDoc sources
    - list-srcfiles on adoc MAINs now also lists docinfo-files
      and includes from includes. Conditionals are _not_
      evaluated, list-srcfiles will always show _all_ included
      adoc files.
      (https://github.com/openSUSE/daps/issues/656)

* Bug fixes:
  - Added documentation on uppercase and lowercase file extensions
    (good: *.png, bad: *.PNG)
    (https://github.com/openSUSE/daps/issues/436)
  - In case a variable was _initially_ assigned with "+=" (VAR+=value)
    rather than with "=" (VAR=value) a space was added in front of
    the value.
  (https://github.com/openSUSE/daps/issues/650)

* Removed features:
  - automatic detection of a single or default DC-file has been
    disabled, the DOCCONF_DEFAULT configuration option has been
    removed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 04 12:36:01 UTC 2016 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

Stable release DAPS 2.3.0:

* New Features:
  - Config File Parser:
    Up to now, config files (DC-files, /tec/daps/config and
    ~/.config/daps/dapsrc) have been sourced. This has been a major
    security issue, since every shell code gets executed when a file
    is being sourced. DAPS 2.3.0 now comes with a parser that fixes
    this security hole. Apart from one exception (see below) existing
    config files do _not_ need to be changed. However, the parser
    offers more flexibility, see
    https://github.com/openSUSE/daps/blob/develop/etc/config.in
    for documentation (the manuals has not been upfdated, yet).
    The only exception that requires changes in the config file is
    something like FOO="$FOO bar" To concatenate values, use "+="
    now. See the following commit for an example:
    https://github.com/openSUSE/daps/commit/7a2ce04
  - Bash Completion:
    TAB-completion for DAPS has been one of the very first feature
    requests we opened (almost five years ago). Now we finally
    managed to conquer the black Bash magic required to get it!
  - Automatically detect the DocBook 5 version: If you have
    DocBook 5.1 installed, docbookxi.rng from 5.1 will
    automatically be used as the validating schema for DocBook 5
    documents. If you rather want to use the 5.0 schema
    or a custom schema, set DOCBOOK5_RNG_URI accordingly in
    /etc/daps/config (for a system wide configuration), in
    $HOME/.config/daps/dapsrc (for a user specific configuration),
    or in the DC-file (for a document-specific configuration)
	
* Bugfixes:
  - subcommand "locdrop" failed when the book did not include
    images
  - spellcheck now ignores text in <replaceable> tags
  - obsolete daps-susespell has been removed (replaced by
    daps ... spellcheck long ago)
  - paths starting with "~" were not always correctly resolved
  - several fixes for ePUB, among them a fix that now correctly
    chooses mediaobject entries with role="html" rather than
    choosing the first one listed ion the XML source
  - #10 : Generate TAB completion
  - #359: Drop bash 3 suppor
  - #369: Code review: Check Variable Assignments
  - #375: Issues with the xmlformat target

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 15 11:58:00 UTC 2016 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

Stable release DAPS 2.2.0:

* New Features:
  - new subcommand "xmlformat" prettyfies the XML sources of a
    given DC-file or ROOTID using daps-xmlformat with
    /etc/daps/docbook-xmlformat.conf.
    (Note: this command will modify the original XML sources!)
  - SVG image support for HTML builds. To use it, make sure to
    provide the images in SVG format and reference to them as follows:
    <imageobject role="html">
     <imagedata fileref="<SVG-FILE>">
    </imageobject>
  - the new global switch --jobs lets you specify how many parallel
    jobs to use. The default is set to the number of CPU cores (as was
    done in previous versions).
  - all commands generating file lists (e.g. "list-srcfiles") now
    generate human readable output on STDOUT. When the output goes
    to a pipe or subshell, it will be generated as a a one-liner.
  - Debugging of XML errors has been made easier. Sometimes the error
    message of the validator only points to an xi:include line, making
    it impossible to find the real location of the error. The option
    --novalid for the target "bigfile" will create the bigfile
    without performing a validation check on the sources. A single XML
    will be built and validated. Now the error message points to the
    exact location of the error in the bigfile. From there it should be
    easy to find the error in the original sources.
  - Verbose and debugging output now also show all profiling
    attributes set in the DC-file, plus version information for
    the sytlesheets (if available)
  - added the option --norefchecks to all output-generating targets
    ("html", "pdf", ...), "validate", "bigfile" and others. Allows
    to build/validate documents without checking internal links
    (<... linkend="<ID>">).
  - subcommand "online-docs" now always converts the bigfile that is
    created to NovDoc. To keep the same format as the original
    sources, specify --dbnoconv. To create a DocBook4 bigfile from
    DocBook5 sources, specify --db5todb4.

* Bugfixes:
  - #368: db4tonovdoc.xsl generates invalid NovDoc
  - #367: daps does not validate fop output
  - #366: Spellcheck trying to check the files "Cannot", "stat:", "No",
          "such", "file" ...

  - #361: Externel xrefs are resolved to "????"
  - #360: Check Rootid fails on Debian 8.4.0
  - #356: file list output should default to pretty format
  - #354: Validate the result of online docs when it has been
          converted from DB5 to DB4 or novdoc
  - #353: Make db5 to db4 conversion default for online-docs
  - #351, #348, #342, #282: Fixes for the daps spec-file
  - #346: daps-xmlformat writes its messages into the output
  - #343: daps-init warning messages
  - #340: ePUB builds always show remarks
  - #335: on Debian, make install creates incorrect group in
          /etc/xml/config
  - #330: Enable SVG2Grayscale stylesheet to handle new color
          names
  - #305: locdrop produces no "non-trans" image tarball for a
          complete set
  - #301: SVG to PNG conversion creates very large PNGs
  - #289: Verbose / Debugging Output Should Show Profiling
          Attributes
  - #251: Write XSLT to Return xml-model PI
  - #226: Let stylesheets know which version of DAPS calls them
  - subcommand "clean-all" fails if run from within a directory
    that will be removed with that command
  - daps fails when called from a directory that no longer exists

* Cross-Distribution Support
  - first release with full Debian/Ubuntu support--manual
    adjustments after the installation are no longer needed
    (was required in previous releases for DocBook5 support).
    Many thanks to Tomáš Bažant and Christoph Berg for their help!
  - GitHub checkouts now also work for Fedora/RedHat and
    Debian/Ubuntu--refer to
    https://github.com/openSUSE/daps/blob/develop/INSTALL.adoc
    for details
  - tested on Debian 8.5.0 / Fedora 23 / openSUSE 13.2 and
    Leap 42.1 / SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 / Ubuntu 16.0

* Misc:
  - removed "daps-envconvert", a script for converting susedoc
    ENV-files to DAPS DC-files. susedoc was the predecessor of
    DAPS.

* Documentation:
  - the documentation has _not_ been updated for this release, so
    new features mentioned above are not yet covered

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Dec 07 14:43:47 UTC 2015 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

Stable release DAPS 2.1.5:

* New Features:
  - parameters for text generation can be set in the config files
    via TXT_PARAMS or via --param/--stringparam on the command line
  - a change introduced in 2.0 made using the original DocBook
    stylesheets for text generation the default. Since this behavior
    is confusing and unexpected, it is reverted with this change:
    * the stylesheets configured via STYLEROOT or --styleroot are
      used by default for text generation
    * to ignore _any_ STYLEROOT definitions, set
      TXT_IGNORE_STYLEROOT="yes" in the config files or use
      --ignore-styleroot on the command line
      (daps -d <DC> text --ignore-styleroot)

* Bugfixes:
  - Fix for issue #294: xmlcatalog returns file:<PATH> rather than
    file://<PATH> on Debian Jessie and openSUSE Tumbleweed and
    caused DAPS to fail with DB5 sources

* Misc
  - added basic debugging output to test suite (--debug)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Dec 02 13:01:00 UTC 2015 - toms@opensuse.org

Fri Dec  6 20:39:09 UTC 2013 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

Version DAPS 2.0~beta1:
- First beta for a new major release

  Output targets:
  ---------------
  * the number of subcommands has been significantly reduced, see
    "daps --commands", "daps help" and "daps help <SUBCOMMAND>" for
    more information
    - "html-single" has been replaced by "html --single"
    - "jsp" has been replaced with "html --jsp"
    - "color-pdf" has been replaced by "pdf" (now produces color PDFS)
    - "pdf" has been replaced by "pdf --grayscale --cropmarks"
    - "projectfiles" and "projectgraphics" have been replaced with
      "list-srcfiles" (see daps help "list-srcfiles" for more options)
    - all dist-* commands have been removed
    - when calling deprecated targets, an error message hinting at a
      valid alternative (is existing) is shown
  * subcommand bigfile now generates a bigfile for the given rootid
    (rather than for the complate set); target bigfile-reduced has been
    dropped
  * subcommands package-pdf and package-html now have switches
    --documentfiles, --desktopfiles and --pagefiles which generate
    the resource files for GNOME and KDE
  * new subcommands
    - "clean-package" removes all generated package data for the given
      DC-file. Generated images and profiled sources will _not_ be
      deleted.
    - "dapsenv" shows a list of the most important make variables
      and their values
    - "images" generates images only for a given rootid. Intended for
      debugging purposes
    - "package-src" (creates a tarball with profiled XML sources and
      images); switch --set-date allows to specify a build date (default
      date is "now")
    - "list-file" lists the filename that contains the ID specified
      with the mandatory parameter --rootid.
  * ePUB generation has been completely rewritten (pure make solution,
    no longer uses the ruby script from upstream); generated ePUBs
    now validate with epubcheck3.
    - added support for .mobi (Amazon Kindle format). Requires calibre.
      (ticket #98)
  * replaced support for HTML4 with support for HTML5 (--html5)
    xhtml remains the default, html4 is no longer supported
  * to nullify a CSS-file definition for HTML or EPUB (HTML_CSS or
    EPUB_CSS) from the DC-file, specify "--css none"

  Miscellaneous:
  --------------
  * now supports XSLT processor saxon6 (in addition to xsltproc),
    specify with --xsltprocessor (default: xsltproc)
  * improved verbosity handling:
    - if output is not a terminal (e.g. pipe) only prints the
      resulting filename (-v0)
    - default verbosity shows a result message plus filename (-v1)
    - -v2 shows additional messages
    - -v3 shows the complete make output from make -j1 (commands are
      executed successively, not parallel)
    - --debug shows the complete make output from make -j1+x
      (commands are executed parallel; this also shows in the debug
      output)
  * added support for JPG images (ticket #101)
  * added support for a "static/" directory in STYLEROOT containing
    css, js and images that are reference in the CSS and the
    stylesheets for HTML
  * New general switch --commands shows all available subcommands
  * if the XML sources are not well-formed, a meaningful error
    message is shown
  * xsltparameters have to be submitted as --param PARAM=VALUE or
    --stringparam PARAM=VALUE (the "=" is mandatory, used to be
    a "space2 with DAPS 1.x)
  * output formats are only re-generated when the source files
    (xml, entity files or images) have changed. To force a rebuild
    run DAPS with --force or run a suitable clean command
  * added switches --author and --productname switches to daps-init

  Config file changes:
  --------------------
  * New config file variables:
    COVERT_OPS_JPG:    command-line options for "convert" for converting
                       jpg images to grayscale
    FOP_STACKSIZE:     set stacksize for fop (ticket #82)
    META, META_STR:    permanently run html and PDF builds with
                       --meta
    STATIC_DIR:        custom static directory
    XML_USER_CATALOGS: add custom catalogs to XML_CATALOG_FILES
                       (ticket #99)
    XSLTPROCESSOR:     Use the specified XSLT processor
                       (saxon6 or xsltproc)

  Code changes:
  -------------
  * big makefile (common.mk) has been split into several small files
    - easier to maintain
    - improved performance by only loading makefiles that are needed
      for the given subcommand
  * added a comprehensive test suite to ensure better quality when
    releasing
  * no longer requires Bash 4--Bash 3 is sufficient

  Documentation:
  --------------
  * Quickstart has been updated to cover DAPS 2.0
  * Update of User Guide is WIP

Version 1.1.4:

[NOTE: Test releases 1.1 to 1.1.3 have not been publicly released]

daps-auto.pl:
  * a perl script to automatically build documents and deploy them
    to a remote machine via rsync

EPUB:
  * completely rewrote the epub generating code
  * no longer needs an external script (db2epub.ruby) for
    epub-file generation - now everything is handled in
    make itself

HTML/HTML-Single/JSP:
  * added a --clean switch which clears the directory
    before generating a new version

Packaging:
  * completely rewrote the code for package-src
    - new option --set-date allows to set a publication date
      (default: current date)
  * new options for package-html and package-pdf
    --desktopfiles: generates an archive with desktopfiles for KDE3
    --documentfiles: generates a document file for KDE4/GNOME2
    --pagefiles: generates a page file for GNOME3
  * completely rewrote online-docs
    - now automatically generates epub, color-pdf and single-html archive
    - new option --export-dir to specify a results directory
  * completely rewrote locdrop
    - new option --export-dir to specify a results directory

Spellchecking:
  * no longer a stand-alone program
  * use "daps -d DC-file spellcheck" to check single files
    (--file option), complete documents (via DC-file) or
    parts of a document (vi ROOTID)
  * can be configured via config variables ASPELL_*

Emacs macros for DocBook:
  * Now supports nxml-mode

Documentation:
  * Significant additions

Misc:
  * Added a --manifest option to dist-html which adds a manifest
    files containing the html-files in the same order as in the
    document
  * Replaced bash 4 only code with bash 3 compatible code
    (bash 4 is no longer a prerequisite for daps)
  * added support for a static/ directory containing resources
    for HTML builds (images, js and css files). If present in
    STYLEROOT, it will be copied as-is and links CSS, JS and
    style-image links in the HTML source will point there

Bugfixes:
  * Ticket #77 Lang variable ($LL) might not be set
  * Ticket #104 Inconsistent Tar Ball for dist-graphics
  * Ticket #113 (daps-xslt/mallard/docbook.xsl missing)
  * Ticket #114 (package-html with easy file names wanted)
  * Ticket #121 package-pdf: --xsltparam missing
  * Ticket #122 package-pdf: --documentfiles fails with clean sources
  * Ticket #127	productinfo sometimes fails and is slow
  * Corrected the webhelp.indexer.language setting
  * a misplaced >/dev/null prevented the svg2svg conversion,
    resulting in 0 byte SVGs
  * added proper error handling to setfiles, sourcefiles, docfiles
    computing
  * html-single output in a separate htmlsingle/ directory
  * Raised FOP_STACK to 2048k, because otherwise FOP builds on
    x86_64 fail
  * Fixed a bug in listing the double images. backup images like
    foo.svg~ or foo.svg.~ were listed, too
  * EPUB generation failed when no CSS file was specified. This
    is fixed now
  * Fixed sed statements for preserving and recovering entities;
    the former statements did not match all entity declarations
    possible and recovering was error-prone
  * Only use optipng when it is available
  * Fixed targets warn-images and warn-cap


-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  3 20:24:49 UTC 2012 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

Version 1.0.2 (Bugfix Release):

* Important:
  - in order to avoid confusion with short options for daps itself
    (such as -d for --docconfig and --draft),
    the subcommands only support long options now. The following
    short options for subcommands are no longer supported:
     -c (use --comments)
     -d (use --draft)
     -f (use --file)
     -m (use --meta)
     -n (use --name)
     -p (use --pretty)
     -r (use --remarks)
     -s (use --show)
  - the only short option that will remain is -h (help)

* Bugfixes:
  - added proper help texts for subcommands
  - target warn-images did not work
  - target missinggraphics did not show all missing images
  - daps failed with a useless error message when $MAIN was not
    well-formed. The fix produces a useful error message now
  - --remarks option did not work with DocBook stylesheets
  - paths specified on the command line or the config file had to
    be absolute. The fix now allows to also specify relative paths
    for all configurable directories and files
  - COMMENTS_STR, DRAFT_STR and REMARK_STR were not correctly unset
    when one of these modes was not set on the command line but
    implied by another mode (e.g. --meta). The result was a wrong
    filename
  - target webhelp-dir-name was missing
  - draft.png was not shown in PDF/HTML draft builds when using the
    DocBook Stylesheets
  - Due to a variable name mismatch, the --name option did not work
    properly
  - target showvariable exited with an error if requested variable
    was empty
  - config options FOP_CONFIG and XEP_CONFIG were not used. The fix
    renames them to FOP_CONFIG_FILE and XEP_CONFIG_FILE - these
    variables are used in the wrapper scripts
  - FOP_WRAPPER and XEP_WRAPPER were not set correctly when
    DAPSROOT was set
  - disabled Permalink generation for PDFs (this is an HTML-only
    feature)
  - images were not cerrectly references for target jsp
  - the DEF file was not correctly packaged in target locdrop
  - fixed webhelp target. Wildcards do not work in classpath
    expression, resolved them with $(wildcard $(firstword())
  - Warning message "DEF file is missing" was issued for targets
    that do not have a --def-file option
  - targets package-html and package-pdf failed with an error on
    desktop files generation
  - target remaininggraphics always returned an empty list
  - SVG to SVG conversions generated useless error messages

* Stylesheets:
  - removed obsolete stuff for @role=productname,
    productnumber, or productnameref

* Documentation:
  - Quick Start Guide: Finished
  - User Guide: Significant additions, but still work in progress
  - Updated README.upgrade_from_susedoc_4.x

Wed Mar 28 08:44:22 UTC 2012 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

Version 1.0 RC1

* Bugfixes:
  - fixed minor package building issues
  - inkscape always returns 0, even in case of an error. Added
    a workaround, so daps now exits when an image conversion with
    inkscape fails
  - --main option should work now
  - Fixed errors on setting the fallback stylesheets
  - comments and remarks did not show up in the docs when requested
    (again ;-(( ) - this is fixed now
* much better error handling - daps will now exit when wrong paths
  or a non existing ROOTID are entered in the user config file
  or the DC file
* significant enhancements to the Documentation
  (Reference & Quickstart)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

* showvariable now only shows the result to make it better suited
  for script usage

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Mar 15 10:12:39 UTC 2012 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

Version 1.0beta2:

* Bugfix:
  Finally found the correct solution for adding/removing catalog
  entries in the spec file
* Enhancement: webhelp support

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Mar  7 15:54:22 UTC 2012 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

Version 1.0beta1:

* Rebuild large parts to make DAPS distribution-independent.
  - rewrote Makefile for automake/autoconf
    => configure; make; make install is now supported
  - thorough cross-distribution testing is still needed, basic tests
    have been run on RedHat, Debian and Ubuntu

* removal of custom stylesheets
  DAPS no longer uses the SUSE stylesheets as a default. It even no
  longer contains the SUSE stylesheets - they are now available as a
  separate package (suse-xsl-stylesheets in Documentation:Tools).

  - By default DAPS uses the generic DocBook stylesheets now
  - Custom stylesheets such as the SUSE stylesheets can be used by
    specifying up to four parameters on the command line/the config
    files:
    * Styleroot:
      Directory containing the custom stylesheets. Must have the same
      directory structure as the original DocBook stylesheet root
      directory. Does _not_ need to contain stylesheets for all output
      formats. If stylesheets are not found, DAPS will automatically
      fall back to the DocBook stylesheets.
      - Variable: STYLEROOT
      - Parameter: --styleroot
      - Value: absolute path to directory
    * Fallback styleroot
      Custom fallback styleroot. If DAPS cannot find styles for the
      given output format, it will automatically fall back to the
      DocBook stylesheets. This config option will add a custom
      fallback directory with higher priority. The DocBook stylesheets
      will remain as a last resort, however.
      - Variable: FALLBACK_STYLEROOT
      - Parameter: --fb_styleroot
      - Value: absolute path to directory
    * CSS files:
      Specify CSS files for HTML and/or CSS. By default no CSS file
      will be used.
      - Variables: HTML_CSS, EPUB_CSS
      - Parameter: --css for html and epub targets
        (daps -d <DC> html--css <CSS> )
      - Value: absolute path to file

* rewrote FOP formatter handling - both supported formatters (FOP/XEP) are
  now controlled by the following variables:
  *_WRAPPER (wrapper script, libexec/daps-fop, libexec/daps-xep by default)
  *_CONFIG (xml config file, etc/daps/xep/xep-daps.xml and
            etc/daps/fop/fop-daps.xml by default. A specific fop-daps.xml
            is installed for RedHat and SUSE by default)
  *_OPTIONS (Command line options)


* renaming of parameters and variables
  In order to make parameters and variables "self-speaking" the
  following has been renamed:

  - File ENV-file to DC-file (doc config file)
  - Variable BASE_DIR to DOC_DIR (doc dir) => Terminology!
  - Variable DTDROOT to DAPSROOT (daps installation directory)
  - Variable FOP_TYPE to FORMATTER

  - command line switch --fop to --formatter
  - command line switch -e/--envfile has been renamed to
    -d/--docconfig (-e/--envfile will still be supported)


* global parameter --base_dir no longer supported

  Instead of specifying --base_dir with daps, you now need to specify a
  full path (either relative or absolute) to the DC-file. However, the
  "magic" that automatically tries to determine the path to a DC-file
  when you do not specify a path or not even a DC file, still applies.
  Therefore you only need to specify a valid path to the DC-file in
  cases where you would have used --base_dir with previous DAPS
  versions.

* --main parameter / MAIN

  Instead of calling daps with -d/--docconfig you can also directly
  specify a MAIN with --main=<PATH>. You need to specify a valid
  relative or absolute path. If you just specify a
  file name, ./xml/$MAIN is automatically assumed.

* packaging

  The former DAPS version has been split into two packages:
  - daps
  - suse-xsl-stylesheets (SUSE stylesheets, NovDOC DTD, SUSE aspell
    wordlist)

* other DAPS changes since 0.9.2 in brief:
  - stylesheet images have been moved to fit the directory structure used
    in the original stylesheets
  - new variable STYLEDEVEL which can be used when developing stylesheets.
    STYLEDEVEL _always_ takes precedence over STYLEROOT and can be set in
    $USER_CONFIG
  - Rewrote handling of profiling variables PROFARCH, PROFCONDITION,
    PROFVENDOR, PROFOS - all 4 are now fully supported (formerly only
    PROFOS and PROFARCH were fully supported)
  - created catalog entry to resolve stylesheets in daps_xslt
  - daps init has been moved to a separate script bin/daps-init
  - each SUSE stylesheet file now contains a short overview of purpose
    and parameters
  - lots of stylesheet bugfixes
  - license: GPL 2.0 or 3.0 at your choice
  - fixed target man for man-page generation; man pages are not gzip'ed
    by default (unless you specify --nogzip); manpage subdirectories
    (man1, man2,...) are no longer created by default, but can rather be
    enabled via the --subdirs switch
  - new parameter --check for target epub checks build with epubcheck
  - added very basic DocBook5 support (with xslt 1.0 stylesheets only)
    still a lot to do on this front
  - Default HTML format is now XHTML 1.0 (instead of HTML 4.01). Use
    --html4 to generate HTML 4.01
  - auto generate SUSE HTML4 stylesheets from XHTML stylesheets
  - binaries that are only called from within make have been moved to
    libexec/

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan  9 15:30:47 UTC 2012 - toms@suse.de

- Really fixed bnc#739213,
- Added COPYING-{2.0,3.0} files

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 28 11:48:06 UTC 2011 - ke@suse.de

- Remove fetch_source.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 28 08:39:57 UTC 2011 - ke@suse.de

- BuildRequire exiftool that's now available as a subpackage on
  Factory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 15 14:07:13 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

New version 0.9.2

- BUGFIXES:
  * fixed misspelled variablename in fo generating target
  * remarks in HTML and PDF builds were only shown when comments
    were turned on, too. This had been fixed earlier but the fix
    seems to have been reverted by mistake. Re-enabled the fix in
    the inline.xslt stxlesheets for fo and html
- -r/--remarks now implies draft mode
- -m/--meta now implies draft mode but does not imply remarks
  anymore

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 15 10:39:31 UTC 2011 - ke@suse.de

- Set license to GPL-2.0+.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Dec 15 06:49:50 UTC 2011 - ke@suse.de

- On 12.1, BuildRequire perl-Image-ExifTool.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Dec  9 11:53:10 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

- BUGFIX: Misspelled variable name in fo generation for FOP
- Stylesheet changes:
  * added first draft of release notes stylesheets

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec  7 13:54:43 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

- Stylesheet changes:
  Fixed bugs:
  * bnc#573835: pdf-color: title in PDF properties too general
  * bnc#703483: FOP: No Hyphenation?
  * bnc#706452: FOP: Too much Whitespace Behind <ulink> and <filename>
  * bnc#711526: Layout: sect3 can not be distinguished from a sect4
  * bnc#719848: daps stylesheets: Make metadata for PDF draft mode optional

- Program changes:
  * New version 0.9.1
  * NEW FEATURES:
    - "daps -h <subcommand>" now shows help for subcommand
    - New config option XSLTPARAM / cmdline switch --xsltparam:
      can be used to overwrite one or more stylesheet
      parameters. Using that option/switch it is possible to change
      the pagesize, pageformat, alignment, margins, etc. etc.
      without having to rewrite the stylesheets directly
    - subcommand getimages can now be run with a rootid or a filename
    - subcommands getimages and checklink can now be invoked without
      a filename or a rootid - in this case the rootid provided by
      the ENV-file is used
    - new general command line switch --version
    - new switch -m/--meta for pdf builds (adds same functionality as
      for the html builds)
  * completely rewrote lib/daps_functions:
    - now has a generic option parser
    - functions setup_builddir and format_options have been
      combined into one function called init_env
    - one single function that invokes make: call_make
    - logging can be turned on/off within each function invoking
      call_make by setting WRITE_LOG to 1/0 (default: 1 (on))
    - the make command is now set up here rather than in bin/daps
    - getimages now uses make to create the image list (rather than
      using /usr/bin/xml)
    - new function no_opts for subcommands that have no command line
      switches
  * pretty printing has been moved from lib/daps_functions into the
    makefiles
  * BUGFIXES:
    - We now do an early! check whether a subcommand is correct
      or not function run_subcmds has therefore been replaced by an
      associative hash; the hash's key/value pairs can be eval'd to
      call the function
    - .fo files will always be regenerated by using PHONY targets
      This also keeps the .fo file, which is desireable for debugging
      purposes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  7 12:28:15 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

- Bugfixes on .document and .desktop file generation

  HTML builds

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 30 22:25:08 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

- Bugfixing HTML generation. Copying/linking images and CSS made
  problems when old builds were present. This fix ensures images/css
  files get removed before trying to create them

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep 30 14:48:36 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

Beta 8:

- new option "--static" for html builds copies images and css files
  rather than linking them (which is the default)
- document-files-html / document-files-pdf / desktop-files now only
  generate the desktop files rather than creating tarballs
  * tarballs are generated with dist-document-files-html, dist-...
  * document-files-dir-name, desktop-files-dir-name show the
    directory names for the generated desktop files
- new file names for PDFs:
  color: ($BOOK|$ROOTID)_$LANG.pdf
  print: ($BOOK|$ROOTID)-print_$LANG.pdf
- new option --def-file=DEFFILE for target package-src. If specified
  also adds all ENV files referenced in the DEF-file to the tarball
- new option --def-file=DEFFILE for target locdrop adds the DEF-file
  to the notrans tarball
- Bugfix:
  * get name targets (pdf-name, html-dir-name,...) now support
    options --name, --rootid, -cdr

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 26 15:36:46 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

- spec file changes so daps builds for SLE 11 / 11.1:
  * checkbot is a recommendation for SLE
  * require python-xml for < 1120
  * replace make_install macro with a literal make install call,
    since 11.1/SLE 11 do not have the macro
- use the tar option --transform instead of --xform in order to be
  compatible with older tar versions
- Bugfix Makefile: global option -d has been replaced with --debug

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 26 11:45:24 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

- target validate now also warns about missing graphics
- Bugfix: verbosity switch -v works correctly now

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 20 11:53:36 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

- verbosity can now also be set to "0" on the command line (needed
  for scripting)
- renamed "--verbose" switch to "--verbosity"
- Specfile: Requires: fam

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 19 11:52:50 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

- Specfile: fixed %{ext_man}
- fetch_source now also copies the spec file if needed

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 19 10:46:07 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

- Completely rewrote the verbosity stuff:
  * Verbosity none: only display on line with result (default)
  * Verbosity 1 (-v, --verbose=1): print the most important target results
  * Verbosity 2 (-vv --verbose=2): print all commands called by make
  * Default verbosity level can be overwritten in ~/.daps/config via
    VERBOSITY=(0|1|2)
- General option -d is no longer supported to avoid confusion with
  subcommand option -d (draft mode) - use --debug instead
- Replaced target clean-book with clean-results
- Updated BUGS and TODO
- Stylesheets:
  * fixed bnc#573835 (PDF metadata)
- Bugfix: BUILD_DIR is now set in the makefiles
- Packaging:
  * added script that generates the source tarball via
    svn export
  * added %{ext_man} to spec file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 19 06:58:53 UTC 2011 - toms@suse.de

- Applied spec file changes after Jan Engelhardt's mail on
  opensuse-packaging:
  (see also http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Specfile_guidelines)
- removal of '# norootforbuild'
- removal of Authors list, no longer desired in factory
- removal of %clean section, no longer required
- adding %{?_smp_mflags} wherever there is none

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 15 20:32:09 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

Beta 7

- DAPS now supports EPS (will be converted to PDF and PNG) and
  PDF images; SVG sources can also be converted into PDF
  - new dependencies for EPS and PDF support in spec file:
    ghostscript-library, poppler tools
- completely revised images.mk to increase readability and improved
  inline documentation
- sped up png optimization with optipng by using optimization level
  2 rather than 8: almost no difference in file-size, but huge
  difference in speed
- Bugfixes:
  - rewrote profiling, since the changes from beta6 introduced
    an error that prevented profiling on changed files

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 12 13:44:08 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

- Bugfix: remove duplicate entries in SRCFILE list in common.mk
          (using sort)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Sep  9 22:33:43 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

Beta 6

- DAPS can now use XML source files with any suffix
  (not only *.xml--the KDE  project for example is using *.docbook);
-  set default values for PROFOS and PROFARCH in case they are empty
- Bugfixes:
  * target validate: call function comments_remarks rather than
    build_generic
  * target locdrop: correct docmanager command; warn if no file has
    doc:trans=yes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  8 15:26:48 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

- this time for real:  adjusted spec file so daps also builds for
  openSUSE_Evergreen_11.2

Beta 5

- print filename and ids for chapter and section headlines
  in draft mode
- added 301 and 302 codes to dontwarn options of checkbot
- start image viewer in target getimages only when there are images

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 11 15:32:45 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

- Reverted previous change since that causes trouble with
  11.3

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 11 14:31:50 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

- Using a stylesheet rather than the buggy /usr/bin/xml to get the
  rootid of a file for target checklink

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 10 14:37:31 UTC 2011 - toms@suse.de

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  8 09:56:15 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

          specified; rootid from ENVfile is ignored

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug  5 15:08:20 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

- BUGFIX: Profiling was only redone when the _xml_ source files had
          changed, not when the entity files had changed - added a
          dependency on *.ent to the profiling target $(PROFILES)
          to fix this

  set to 1). Options -r and -c have been removed again.
- Bugfix: Using $@ instead of $SCMD_ARGS in getopts calls in
  lib/daps_functions

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug  1 11:33:13 UTC 2011 - fsundermeyer@opensuse.org

- we need to be able to install daps and susedoc in parallel
  internally, so removed the Obsoletes: susedoc statement

First beta of the DocBook Authoring and Publishing Suite (daps),
the successor of susedoc. Major changes compared to susedoc:

* make calls have been replaced by central wrapper script daps
  with svn/git style syntax
* Independent from shell environment
* All output generated by susedoc is placed in <wd>/build (default)
  or in <BUILDDIR> (can be spcified on the copmmand line)
* Strict separation between generated content and source files
* Typical Linux configuration style hierarchy established:
  - System wide configuration ( /etc/daps/config )
  - User configuration ( ~/.daps/config )
  - Book specific (ENVfile)
  - Command line
* STDOUT output much less verbose, log file is written
* Debugging function
* bugfixes
