Conditional Color echo

Usage: ccecho LEVEL "MESSAGE"

Prints a colored message string to STDOUT using bash color codes. The
color depends on one of the LEVEL keyword. When the SHELL environment
variable COLOR is set to either "0" or "no" no color output is
generated.

The main purpose of this script is to provide an easy method to generate
colored output when the output should go to STDOUT, and regular output
(with no color codes messing up the output) for log files, pipes and
scripts (by exporting COLOR=0)


LEVEL keywords
  normal -> no color
  error  -> bold red
  info   -> purple
  result -> green
  warn   -> red

MESSAGE
  The message to be printed. Needs to be quoted using double quotes.
  You may use sequences supported by echo (1) such as \n to insert a
  newline and \t to insert a tab.
