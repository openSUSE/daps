 <title>Migration of Existing DocBook Projects</title>
 <para>
   This section provides instructions how to migrate existing DocBook
   projects so that you can use &dapsacr; for managing and publishing them.
  </para>

  <procedure id="pro.daps.user.migrate">
   <title>Making DocBook Projects Compatible with &dapsacr;</title>
   <step>
    <para>
     If your XML files are distributed across several subdirectories,
     flatten the hierarchy and put all XML files directly into the
     <filename>xml</filename> subdirectory that is required by &dapsacr;.
     See
     <xref linkend="ex.daps.dir.doc" xrefstyle="select:title"/>.
     Hosting multiple documentation projects in the same
     <filename>xml</filename> directory is fine as long as the file names
     are unique. You can put multiple Main files there.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     If you have any XIncludes or entity declaration files, also put them
     into the <filename>xml</filename> subdirectory.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Depending on the file type of your source images, add them to the
     respective subdirectories in
     <filename><replaceable>YOUR_DOC_DIR</replaceable>/images/src</filename>.
     The <filename>image</filename> directory and its substructure is
     required by &dapsacr;. For details, refer to
     <xref linkend="ex.daps.dir.doc" xrefstyle="select:title"/>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Make sure that the base names of your image files are unique. For
     details, refer to <xref linkend="sec.daps.user.imgs.dir"/>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Adjust all references of image files, Xincludes, and entity
     declarations, in the existing XML files to match the structure required
     by &dapsacr;. The references must not include any absolute or relative
     path, the plain file name is enough.
     <remark>taroth 2012-04-12: maybe add examples for
      image names, Xincludes and entity-decl? see commented section
      below</remark>
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     For each deliverable (book, article, set) that you want to generate
     from your XML files, create a &dclong; file. For more information,
     refer to <xref linkend="sec.daps.user.basics.files"/>. Find a template
     for &dc; files in your installed system in
     <filename>/usr/share/daps/init_templates/&dc;-file.template</filename>.
    </para>
   </step>
  </procedure>

  <para>
   If you have already used &dapsacr;' predecessor <literal>susedoc</literal>,
   use the <filename>/usr/bin/daps-envconvert</filename> script for
   migrating your ENV files to &dc; files. For a short overview of the main
   changes, refer to
   <filename>/usr/share/doc/packages/daps/README.upgrade_from_susedoc_4.x</filename>.
   In contrast to susedoc, &dapsacr; uses the DocBook layout by default. The
   &suse; stylesheets have been moved to a separate package,
   <systemitem class="resource">suse-xsl-stylesheets</systemitem>. It is
   available from the &suse-dapsrepo; repository. If you want to continue
   using the &suse;-layout for your documentation projects, install this
   package in addition to &dapsacr;. To make &dapsacr; use the &suse;
   layout, adjust the <parameter>STYLEROOT</parameter> parameter in the &dc;
   files of your documentation projects.

  as chapter contains some information: For more information, refer to
