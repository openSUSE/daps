         Creates a subdirectory containing individual HTML files for all
         chapters of a book (including also preface, glossary or appendix
         files). The HTML files are named according to the ID of the
         respective root element.
         Open the generated <filename>index.html</filename> file in a Web
         browser to view the generated HTML from the starting point (ROOTID
         of the top-level element).

       <para>
         Images and CSS files are only linked in the resulting directory
         that contains the HTML files. To copy these files to the same
         location like the HTML files, use the <option>--static</option>
         option. This is useful for creating distributable HTML builds.

         Experimental feature. Requires a very recent version of the DocBook
         stylesheets. DocBook &webh; consists of HTML pages with an
         additional pane, featuring a table of contents and a search
         function. The table of contents can be expanded and collapsed and
         is automatically synchronized with the contents pane. The search
         function weights the search results so that the most relevant
         results are listed first.

       <para>
         To create man pages, your XML files must contain at least one
         <sgmltag>refentry</sgmltag>&mdash;be it in a
         <sgmltag>chapter</sgmltag>, <sgmltag>appendix</sgmltag>, or
         collected in a <sgmltag>reference</sgmltag> element. When
         processing a DocBook document with multiple
         <sgmltag>refentry</sgmltag> elements (regardless where they
         appear), &dapsacr; generates one man page file per
         <sgmltag>refentry</sgmltag> element. All other parts of the
         document will be ignored.
        </para>
<!--taroth 2012-04-11: additional
        information to be covered in User Guide: The file name for each man
        page is generated from refentry content elements. The file name prefix
        is the refname, and the suffix is the manvolnum from within the
        refmeta element. If you are processing many refentrys from the same
        document, make sure they will all produce unique file names, or else
        any duplicates will overwrite each other.-->
