  Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA
 </p><p>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
  license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 </p><div class="sect2 "><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title legal" id="idm140174603250672"><span class="name">Preamble</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="bk01apd.html#idm140174603250672">#</a></h3></div></div></div><p>
   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
   share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
   intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
   make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
   License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation’s software
   and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other
   Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
   Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
  </p><p>
   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
   Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
   freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
   service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
   want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
   programs; and that you know you can do these things.
  </p><p>
   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
   to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
   restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
   distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
  </p><p>
   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
   or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
   You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
   And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
  </p><p>
   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
   (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
   distribute and/or modify the software.
  </p><p>
   Also, for each author’s protection and ours, we want to make
   certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
   software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
   want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
   that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
   authors’ reputations.
  </p><p>
   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
   We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
   individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
   proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
   be licensed for everyone’s free use or not licensed at all.
  </p><p>
   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
   modification follow.
  </p></div><div class="sect2 "><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title legal" id="idm140174606696080"><span class="name">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="bk01apd.html#idm140174606696080">#</a></h3></div></div></div><p><span class="formalpara-title">0. </span>
    This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
    the terms of this General Public License. The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Program</span>”</span>,
    below, refers to any such program or work, and a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">work based on
    the Program</span>”</span> means either the Program or any derivative work
    under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
    translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included
    without limitation in the term <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">modification</span>”</span>.) Each
    licensee is addressed as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">you</span>”</span>.
   </p><p>
   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
   covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
   the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered
   only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent
   of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends
   on what the Program does.
  </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">1. </span>
    You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices
    that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give
    any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with
    the Program.
   </p><p>
   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
   may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
  </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">2. </span>
    You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
    thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
    modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that
    you also meet all of these conditions:
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">a). </span>
    You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
    that you changed the files and the date of any change.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">b). </span>
    You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to
    be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms
    of this License.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">c). </span>
    If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
    redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user
    how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is
    interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work
    based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
   </p><p>
   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
   sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
   reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
   this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
   distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
   sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
   distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
   permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
   each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
  </p><p>
   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
   your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
   exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
   collective works based on the Program.
  </p><p>
   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
   with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
   storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
   scope of this License.
  </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">3. </span>
    You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
    Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">a). </span>
    Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
    above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">b). </span>
    Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">c). </span>
    Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
    distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
    Subsection b above.)
   </p><p>
   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
   making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
   means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
   associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
   compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
   exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
   normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
   components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which
   the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
   executable.
  </p><p>
   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
   to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
   the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
   code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
   along with the object code.
  </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">4. </span>
    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except
    as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
    modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
    full compliance.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">5. </span>
    You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
    it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute
    the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law
    if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
    distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you
    indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and
    conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works
    based on it.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">6. </span>
    Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
    on the recipients’ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are
    not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this
    License.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">7. </span>
    If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
    distribution of the Program.
   </p><p>
   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply
   and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
  </p><p>
   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
   patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such
   claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of
   the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public
   license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the
   wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on
   consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor
   to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any
   other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
  </p><p>
   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
   a consequence of the rest of this License.
  </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">8. </span>
    If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">9. </span>
    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.
   </p><p>
   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
   <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">any later version</span>”</span>, you have the option of following the
   terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
   published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not
   specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever
   published by the Free Software Foundation.
  </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">10. </span>
    If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
    whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask
    for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
    Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
    exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
    preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

     BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
     FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
     OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
     PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
     KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
     IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
     PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE
     COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">12. </span>
     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
     WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
     REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
     DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
     DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
     (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
     INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
     THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
     OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
   possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
   free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
   terms.
  </p><p>
   To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
   attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
   the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
   <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">copyright</span>”</span> line and a pointer to where the full notice is
   found.

  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
  license document, but changing it is not allowed.

   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
   functional and useful document “free” in the sense of
   freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
   redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or
   noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and
   publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered
   responsible for modifications made by others.
  </p><p>
   This License is a kind of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">copyleft</span>”</span>, which means that
   derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same
   sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
   license designed for free software.
  </p><p>
   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
   software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program
   should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software
   does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used
   for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is
   published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for
   works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
  </p></div><div class="sect2 "><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title legal" id="idm140174618784272"><span class="name">APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="bk01apd.html#idm140174618784272">#</a></h3></div></div></div><p>
   This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
   contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
   distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
   world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work
   under the conditions stated herein. The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Document</span>”</span>, below,
   refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a
   licensee, and is addressed as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">you</span>”</span>. You accept the license
   if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
   under copyright law.
  </p><p>
   A <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Modified Version</span>”</span> of the Document means any work
   containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or
   with modifications and/or translated into another language.
  </p><p>
   A <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Secondary Section</span>”</span> is a named appendix or a front-matter
   section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
   the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
   subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
   directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a
   textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
   mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection
   with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
   philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
  </p><p>
   The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Invariant Sections</span>”</span> are certain Secondary Sections
   whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
   notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a
   section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
   allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
   Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
   Sections then there are none.
  </p><p>
   The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Cover Texts</span>”</span> are certain short passages of text that
   are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that
   says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text
   may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
  </p><p>
   A <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Transparent</span>”</span> copy of the Document means a
   machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is
   available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the
   document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
   composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
   available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
   formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable
   for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent
   file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to
   thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
   Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any
   substantial amount of text. A copy that is not <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Transparent</span>”</span>
   is called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Opaque</span>”</span>.
  </p><p>
   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
   without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
   using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
   PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
   transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
   include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
   proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
   processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
   HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
   purposes only.
  </p><p>
   The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Title Page</span>”</span> means, for a printed book, the title page
   itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
   material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
   formats which do not have any title page as such, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Title
   Page</span>”</span> means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
   work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
  </p><p>
   A section <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Entitled XYZ</span>”</span> means a named subunit of the
   Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in
   parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here
   XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
   <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Acknowledgments</span>”</span>, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Dedications</span>”</span>,
   <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Endorsements</span>”</span>, or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">History</span>”</span>.) To
   <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Preserve the Title</span>”</span> of such a section when you modify the
   Document means that it remains a section <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Entitled XYZ</span>”</span>
   according to this definition.
  </p><p>
   The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
   states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
   Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
   but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
   these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
   meaning of this License.
  </p></div><div class="sect2 "><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title legal" id="idm140174604208288"><span class="name">VERBATIM COPYING</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="bk01apd.html#idm140174604208288">#</a></h3></div></div></div><p>
   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
   commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
   copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
   the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
   conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical
   measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
   copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in
   exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies
   you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
  </p><p>
   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
   may publicly display copies.
  </p></div><div class="sect2 "><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title legal" id="idm140174604911136"><span class="name">COPYING IN QUANTITY</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="bk01apd.html#idm140174604911136">#</a></h3></div></div></div><p>
   If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
   printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
   Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
   the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
   Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the
   back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
   publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
   with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
   other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to
   the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
   satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
   respects.
  </p><p>
   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
   you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
   actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
  </p><p>
   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
   than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
   along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
   computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
   access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
   Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
   latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
   distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
   Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until
   at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy
   (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
   public.
  </p><p>
   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
   Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
   them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
  </p></div><div class="sect2 "><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title legal" id="idm140174604910016"><span class="name">MODIFICATIONS</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="bk01apd.html#idm140174604910016">#</a></h3></div></div></div><p>
   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
   conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
   Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
   filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
   modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
   In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
  </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">A. </span>
    Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from
    that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should,
    if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document).
    You may use the same title as a previous version if the original
    publisher of that version gives permission.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">B. </span>
    List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
    together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document
    (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they
    release you from this requirement.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">C. </span>
    State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
    Version, as the publisher.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">D. </span>
    Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">E. </span>
    Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to
    the other copyright notices.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">F. </span>
    Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
    giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms
    of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">G. </span>
    Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and
    required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">H. </span>
    Include an unaltered copy of this License.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">I. </span>
    Preserve the section Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">History</span>”</span>, Preserve its
    Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
    authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title
    Page. If there is no section Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">History</span>”</span> in the
    Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of
    the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the
    Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">J. </span>
    Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
    access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
    locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.
    These may be placed in the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">History</span>”</span> section. You may omit
    a network location for a work that was published at least four years
    before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
    it refers to gives permission.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">K. </span>
    For any section Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Acknowledgments</span>”</span> or
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Dedications</span>”</span>, Preserve the Title of the section, and
    preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the
    contributor acknowledgments and/or dedications given therein.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">L. </span>
    Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their
    text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not
    considered part of the section titles.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">M. </span>
    Delete any section Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Endorsements</span>”</span>. Such a section
    may not be included in the Modified Version.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">N. </span>
    Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Endorsements</span>”</span> or to conflict in title with any Invariant
    Section.
   </p><p><span class="formalpara-title">O. </span>
    Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
   </p><p>
   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
   that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from
   the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these
   sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of
   Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These
   titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
  </p><p>
   You may add a section Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Endorsements</span>”</span>, provided it
   contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
   parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been
   approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
   standard.
  </p><p>
   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
   passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
   Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text
   and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made
   by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the
   same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same
   entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
   replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher
   that added the old one.
  </p><p>
   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
   give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
   imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
  </p></div><div class="sect2 "><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title legal" id="idm140174605497408"><span class="name">COMBINING DOCUMENTS</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="bk01apd.html#idm140174605497408">#</a></h3></div></div></div><p>
   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
   License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
   versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
   Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list
   them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
   notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
  </p><p>
   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
   multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy.
   If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different
   contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end
   of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of
   that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment
   to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license
   notice of the combined work.
  </p><p>
   In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
   <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">History</span>”</span> in the various original documents, forming one
   section Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">History</span>”</span>; likewise combine any sections
   Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Acknowledgments</span>”</span>, and any sections Entitled

   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
   released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
   License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
   the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
   verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
  </p><p>
   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
   it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
   License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other
   respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
  </p></div><div class="sect2 "><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title legal" id="idm140174606258448"><span class="name">AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="bk01apd.html#idm140174606258448">#</a></h3></div></div></div><p>
   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
   independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
   copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal
   rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works
   permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does
   not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
   derivative works of the Document.
  </p><p>
   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
   of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
   aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that
   bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent
   of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must
   appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
   translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
   Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
   their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
   Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
   Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and
   all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers,
   provided that you also include the original English version of this
   License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In
   case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version
   of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
   prevail.

   If a section in the Document is Entitled <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Acknowledgments</span>”</span>,
   <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Dedications</span>”</span>, or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">History</span>”</span>, the requirement
   (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require
   changing the actual title.

   replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:
  </p><div class="verbatim-wrap"><pre class="screen">with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.</pre></div><p>
   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
   combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
   situation.
