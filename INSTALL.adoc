[#install-package]
== Installing DAPS using a system package

Pre-built packages are available for openSUSE from the following repositories:

SUSE::
  http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Documentation:Tools/ +
  Browse to this URL and choose you SUSE version to get the complete
  repository URl and add it with the `zypper ar` command, for example:
  `zypper ar -f http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Documentation:Tools/openSUSE_Leap_42.2 Documentation:Tools`
  To be able to use the complete functionality of DAPS, make sure to
  also install all recommended packages (`zypper in --recommends --from Documentation:Tools daps`) +
        +
  Packages for daily builds are available from
  https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Documentation:Tools:Auto/
  Note that these builds are not thoroughly tested and may contain bugs.

Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu::
  Not available, yet. Help is appreciated.

The package is named +daps+. Additional packages needed by DAPS will
automatically be installed.


[#dependency]
== Package dependencies and prerequisites

DAPS only runs on Linux and is not compatible with other operating systems.
DAPS requires a few programs to be installed on your system. To use the full
feature set of DAPS, make sure to also install the optional packages. If
unsure, which of DAPS's features are supported with your current installation,
run `./configure --sysconfdir=/etc` in the DAPS Git clone directory. This
will output detailed information about the support status on your system.

run `daps-check-deps` to check for already installed and missing dependencies.


[#install-source]
== Installing DAPS from the source

DAPS can be installed from a downloaded release TAR or from a local Git clone.

1. Download the https://github.com/openSUSE/daps/releases/latest[latest DAPS version]
archive and unpack it _or_, alternatively clone the main branch from GitHub: +
   `git clone https://github.com/openSUSE/daps.git -b main --single-branch`
2. Change into the daps directory
3. Run `./configure --sysconfdir=/etc` +
   Carefully check the configuration summary. Run `./configure --help` for
   more information on how to change installation paths. If you need to change
   something, re-run the configure command again afterwards.
4. Run `make`
5. Run `sudo make install`
6. Run `daps --help` for a brief introduction to DAPS


[#run-from-git]
== Running DAPS from a local Git clone

If you do not want to install DAPS or always want to use the latest
development version, you can run DAPS directly from a local Git clone.

1. Make sure the prerequisites listed in <<anchor-1>> are fulfilled.
2. Check out DAPS. Either choose the latest stable version (safe) or the
   development version (may not work)
   Checking out the latest release::
     `git clone https://github.com/openSUSE/daps.git -b main --single-branch`
   Checking out the latest development version::
     `git clone https://github.com/openSUSE/daps.git`
3. (Skip this step for SUSE). Go to the checkout directory and run the
   following command according to your distribution:
   Debian/Ubuntu::
     `./configure --sysconfdir=/etc` +
     `make debian`
   Fedora/Red Hat::
     `./configure --sysconfdir=/etc` +
     `make redhat`
   SUSE::
     _Do nothing_
4. Test DAPS by building the DAPS user manual: +
   `cd <path_to_checkout>/daps/doc` +
   `../bin/daps --dapsroot .. -d DC-daps-user pdf`

To run DAPS from the checkout directory, use the following command: +
`<path_to_checkout>/bin/daps --dapsroot=<path_to_checkout>
[options] <subcommand> [options]`
